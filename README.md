Hey! It's my first big React.js project ^^
This is a blog. People can write something on their pages, comment on other posts, put likes and maybe repost :D. In this project I learned and used a many different React features. 

### tech stack ###
Client: 
1. React.js
2. React router
3. Vite webpack
4. HTML + CSS
5. Redux (?)
   
Server:
1. Node.js + express.js
2. Sql database (pgsql)

That's all! <br>
Have a nice day/night <br>
